AND ALSO
TODO: MUST be done items, in the present and immediate future
nice to have: not prioritary, not intended for immediate action
improvement: features who represent an improvement over current functionalities (perfomance, quality, features etc.)
issue: pending issue that is intended to be solved in the near future
limitation: - can be for example accepted range for parameters or memory or etc.
known bug: pending issues related to testing and that will be fixed in the longer future. Typically for resistant issues
note: just a comment that is singled out from the rest of the text
dependency: - list of dependencies for the function, can be env. variables, global variable, external DS etc. Can be
specified by using require as they have to be loaded
side-effect:
test code: // TEST CODE begin of block and /////// end of block

TOOLS
cf docco for automatic generation of doc from sources.

PRINCIPLES:
- all functions have to be documented at their beginning
- inside-function comments must be updated to reflect modification of the function they relate to
- All TODOs must be at the top of the file
- All comments should be in immediate context and doc should be there
