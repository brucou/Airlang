CanJS : Careful!
- bug, I needed to put a value {{{}}} to null before changing it
- it can be tricky to understand how the live binding works : always test it first
- EJS and mustache have different conventions and offers different possibilities (helpers in mustache, data in EJS)
- Investigate the Can.Model.List even if it is mostly linked to CRUD Rest functionalities (vs. socket.io)
- it is actually kind of hard to mentalize all the information in the views that is reused back in the code (controller)
- - this includes ids, classes, etc. That means that the views has to be documented??...
- - - meaning documentation will have be to sync with changed in view...
- start always with index.html, then make the way through looking up the scripts that are being loaded...
- TO TEST : if {RT.var} works as well, e.g. if the {} mechanism in event selector allow for . indirection
- - would allow to be used in conjunction with require.js instead of declaring model in window like in examples so far
- When a model is defined, and a new operation is performed, a 'created' event is launched with the model as a source
